How to publish a new release
Now your release workflow is:
1.	Go to your repo on GitHub → Releases → Draft a new release
2.	Create a new tag (e.g. v0.5.1), fill in the title/notes → Publish release
3.	The action automatically runs build-installer.ps1, produces FTdx101_WebApp_Setup.exe, and attaches it to the release
The file will appear under Assets on the release page — users just click to download it. No local build needed on your end.
